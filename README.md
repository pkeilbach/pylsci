# PyLSCI

A Python Package for Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging.

It converts raw laser speckle data (as 2D or 3D NumPy arrays) to laser speckle contrast images (a 2D NumPy array).

The code for this package was developed for my thesis on 
[Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection using Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329391997_Fingerprint_Presentation_Attack_Detection_using_Laser_Speckle_Contrast_Imaging):

International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG), Darmstadt, 2018, pp. 1-6, doi: https://10.23919/BIOSIG.2018.8552931.

## Installation

```sh
pip install pylsci
```

## Dependencies

The PyLSCI packages depends on [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), 
which is is used to do all the array related calculations.

## Workflow

To work with this package, you need to have you laser speckle images available as 2D or 3D NumPy arrays:

- For spatial contrast calculation, PyLSCI expects a single, raw laser speckle image as a 2D NumPy Array.
- For temporal or spatio-temporal contrast calculation, 
PyLSCI expects a time series of multiple raw laser speckle images as a 3D NumPy Array.

> The process of converting the raw laser speckle images to NumPy arrays is out of scope of the `pylsci` package,
> since this process is highly dependent on a particular LSCI setup.
> See the [demo](https://github.com/pkeilbach/pylsci/blob/develop/demo.ipynb) notebook for an example.   

## Usage

The following code provides a quick demo of how to use the PyLSCI package. 
For a more detailed documentation, please see the 
[Jupyter Notebook `demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/pkeilbach/pylsci/blob/develop/demo.ipynb)
that is provided in this GitHub project.

```python
from pylsci import Lsci
# for this example, it is assumed you have a custom helper module (here it is the util.py module)
# that is responsible for converting your raw laser speckle images to the NumPy arrays expected by PyLSCI
from util import convert_speckle_to_numpy

# 1. Loading Raw Laser Speckle Data to NumPy Arrays
# 
# speckle_img represents a single laser speckle image as 2D NumPy array for spatial contrast ccalculation
speckle_img = convert_speckle_to_numpy('img/spatial.tif')
# speckle_img_sequence represents a time series of speckle images as a NumPy 3D array 
# for temporal or spatio-temporal contrast calculation,
# where the first dimension is the number of images
speckle_img_sequence = convert_speckle_to_numpy('img/temporal.png', temporal_series=True)

# 2. Create a Lsci Object
# 
# you can pass custom values for the spatial and temporal neighborhoos arguments nbh_s and nbh_t.
# Their values default to nbh_s=3 and nbh_t=25 if you omit them.
# Note that nbh_s needs to be an odd value, but there is no constraint for nbh_t
lsci = Lsci(nbh_s=5, nbh_t=40)

# 3. Calculate the Laser Speckle Contrast Images
#
# 3.1 Spatial Contrast Calculation 
# The spatial contrast calculation requires a single laser speckle image as a NumPy 2D array
# and returns a single laser speckle contrast image as a 2D NumPy array.
s_lsci = lsci.spatial_contrast(speckle_img)

# 3.2 Temporal Contrast Calculation
# The temporal and spatio-temporal contrast calculation require a 3D NumPy array (time series of laser speckle images)
# and will return a single (averaged) laser speckle contrast image as a 2D NumPy array.
t_lsci = lsci.temporal_contrast(speckle_img_sequence)
st_lsci = lsci.spatio_temporal_contrast(speckle_img_sequence)

```

## Implementation Details

Note that the iterations of the 2D or 3D arrays are not (yet) optimized. 
The `temporal_contrast()` function performs quite well, 
since NumPy allows to calculate the standard deviation and mean along the temporal axis for the whole array.
This is not the case for the `spatial_contrast()` and `spatio_temporal_contrast()` functions,
where the implementations rely on inefficient, nested loops.

Please be aware of this as calculating the contrast 
with the `spatial_contrast()` and `spatio_temporal_contrast()` functions may take a long time.
